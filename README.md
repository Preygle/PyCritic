AST
An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a tree representation of the structural and semantic elements of a program's source code. It's a condensed version of a parse tree, focusing on the essential aspects of the code's structure. ASTs are used by compilers, interpreters, and other tools to analyze, manipulate, and generate code. 

Random Forest
It used multiple decision trees to make prediction,each tree is somewhat different and and the actuial classification is done by averaging the results
. It redices error and overfitting, which was the main issue in normal decision trees.

F1 Score
H.M of Precision and Recall
Precision: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
Recall :True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

Scalar fitting is done only on train data as test data is only supposed to be used for testing and not to be touched while training (can cause overfitting)
